The final deliverableâ€™s main goal is to create a student query tool, which is a flexible program that can read a file and output different results based on a set menu. The menu will give the user options to choose from such as, viewing the entire student record, students whose last names begin with a certain string, and students who are graduating in a certain year. The program should also be able to handle a variety of errors from different sources. Some errors include: if the user inputs an incorrect query option (either numeric or non - numeric), if a last name for the second query (last name search query) is not found, or if a year for the third query (graduation year search query) is not found.
